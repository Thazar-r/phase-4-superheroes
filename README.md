- POST /hero_powers
  - Creates a new association between a hero and a power.

Database Structure

The application uses a relational database structure with the following models:

- Hero
  - id: Unique identifier for the hero.
  - name: Real name of the hero.
  - super_name: Superhero name of the hero.

- Power
  - id: Unique identifier for the power.
  - name: Name of the superpower.
  - description: Description of the superpower.

- HeroPower
  - id: Unique identifier for the hero-power relationship.
  - hero_id: Foreign key referencing a hero.
  - power_id: Foreign key referencing a power.
  - strength: Indicates the strength of the power for the hero (e.g., Strong, Weak, Average).

Running the Application

To run the application, make sure your PostgreSQL database is running and then execute:

python app.py

This will start the Flask development server, and you can access the API at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Testing the API

You can test the API using Postman or cURL. Import the provided Postman collection to explore the various endpoints and see their responses.
